# LLama model proof of concept

This is a proof of concept for the LLama model. The LLama model is a model for the representation of the structure of a document. It is based on the idea that a document is a collection of sections, each of which is a collection of paragraphs, each of which is a collection of sentences, each of which is a collection of words. The LLama model is designed to be simple and easy to understand, while still being powerful enough to capture the structure of a wide range of documents.

The LLama model is implemented in Python, using the `llama` package. The `llama` package provides a simple API for working with LLama documents, including functions for creating, reading, and writing documents, as well as functions for manipulating the structure of a document.

## Installation

To install the `llama` package, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install llama-stack
```

## List available models

```bash
llama model list --show-all
```
